Problem
For positive integers a and n, a modulo n (written amodn in shorthand) is the remainder when a is divided by n. For example, 29mod11=7 because 29=11×2+7.

Modular arithmetic is the study of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with respect to the modulo operation. We say that a and b are congruent modulo n if amodn=bmodn; in this case, we use the notation a≡bmodn.

Two useful facts in modular arithmetic are that if a≡bmodn and c≡dmodn, then a+c≡b+dmodn and a×c≡b×dmodn. To check your understanding of these rules, you may wish to verify these relationships for a=29, b=73, c=10, d=32, and n=11.

As you will see in this exercise, some Rosalind problems will ask for a (very large) integer solution modulo a smaller number to avoid the computational pitfalls that arise with storing such large numbers.

Given: A protein string of length at most 1000 aa.

Return: The total number of different RNA strings from which the protein could have been translated, modulo 1,000,000. (Don't neglect the importance of the stop codon in protein translation.)
